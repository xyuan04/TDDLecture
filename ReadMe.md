# TDD Lecture W/ Jack Harris

*Reserved*

write test just enough for it to fail
write code to pass test
write more test to fail

reasons to use TDD
structures your thoughts and prevents you from writing bad code
clean code - method should do 1 thing
reduces the fear of cleaning your code - passing all tests before change vs passing all test after change
